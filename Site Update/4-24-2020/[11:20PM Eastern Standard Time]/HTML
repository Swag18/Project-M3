    <h1>Max.O Begs for $900 For A Puppet!</h1>
    <h4>Published 4/24/2020 2:10 AM</h4>
    
    <p>It was reported on April 22nd that Max.o (A former student of animation) begged a friend for $900 in<br> order to get a puppet for whatever reason. It was also confirmed by a few individuals who interact with<br> Max.O Rcently, Max.O was being
        condecending for his actions. After people pleaded that he apologize,<br> he denies and continued to be condencending. Jokes have been thrown around for the past few days <br> about the incident but for now things have calmed down and some server members
        hope that Max.O <br>improves his behavior and takes in consideration of others as well as what is currently going on in the<br> world. Lastly, many ban hammers have been brought down on Max.O as well as blocks, we have not<br> confirmed yet that those moves were 
        lifted. (The following is eyewitness)<p></p>
